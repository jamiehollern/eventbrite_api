Eventbrite API
--------------

This module is intended to be a replacement for the Eventbrite module located 
at https://drupal.org/project/eventbrite as the development of the module 
is far away from where it needs to be. Hopefully the code for this module 
can be merged with the "official" Eventbrite module at some point in the 
future.

Installation
------------

The module depends on Entity API - https://drupal.org/project/entity. 
It also requires the eventbrite.php class which is essentially a 
PHP wrapper for the Eventbrite API. Download this into your libraries 
folder from https://github.com/ryanjarvinen/eventbrite.php.
