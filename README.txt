Eventbrite API for Drupal 8.x
----------------------------
Eventbrite API allows Drupal to integrate with the Eventbrite event booking
service. The module allows the user to pull data from Eventbrite to be displayed
on their Drupal site and allows new events, tickets, organizers and venues to be
uploaded to Eventbrite directly from Drupal.
